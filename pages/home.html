    <p class="aboutme">
       After recruiting high-end technical professionals in the information technology industry for two years, I am committed to a career in technology. I reconfirmed my desire to strengthen my technical capabilities in order to align my skills with my lifelong passions.

      Over the past four months, I have been studying Front-End Development as I begin this new journey of continued technical learning, constant problem solving, and uncapped creative collaboration. Despite my recent focus on front-end technologies, I am eager to join an innovative team and expand my knowledge with back-end technologies.
